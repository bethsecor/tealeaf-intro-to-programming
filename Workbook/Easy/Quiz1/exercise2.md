Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby.
! after an instance method mutates the caller, and before a boolean variable it makes it the opposite value.
? after a variable returns a boolean.

And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:
1. what is != and where should you use it? - It means not equals, and you should use it to see if something is not equal to something.
2. put ! before something, like !user_name - returns a boolean, the opposite
3. put ! after something, like words.uniq! - mutates the caller
4. put ? before something
5. put ? after something - with a colon it is like if/else
6. put !! before something, like !!user_name  - returns a boolean
